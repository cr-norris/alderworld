excerpt: Bringing together entrepreneurs, investors, and thought leaders from around the U.S. for the most significant event addressing climate change in Vermont's history.

about: | 
    Catalysts of the Climate Economy (cc:econ) was a three-day national innovation summit in Burlington, Vermont to bring together entrepreneurs, investors, and thought leaders pushing toward the next stage of economic development and prosperity in a low-carbon future. We worked with the Vermont Council on Rural Development to build the identity, branding, website, content, and marketing strategy of the summit from the ground up. Our goal? Attract a national audience of change-makers seeking to leave their mark on the planet (figuratively).
    
    After establishing a base of creative work including video, imagery, and writing, we began plotting strategies for partnerships, press, social media, advertising, and engagement with speakers and attendees.

    Over several months, we advanced through our tactics and built a network of support across the globe. The summit received attention on social media, blogs, and industry publications from the likes of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the World Bankâ€™s Connect4Climate initiative, 1% for the Planet, Green America, the American Sustainable Business Council, and over one hundred other organizations seeking to create a brighter future.

    One of our objectives was to attract young entrepreneurs to the summit. We developed the #FutureFormula Pitch Contest that resulted in start-up companies from across the country submitting ideas to compete for seed funding. We connected with Green Mountain Power to sponsor the contest by offering access to Inspire Space, a coworking facility inside the GMP headquarters built for young, innovative energy companies. The contest resulted in ten startups traveling to Burlington to pitch the hundreds of attendees and a specially curated panel of judges from organizations including the California Clean Energy Fund, Connecticut Green Bank, Vermont Works, and others.
