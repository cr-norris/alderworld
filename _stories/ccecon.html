        <p>Catalysts of the Climate Economy (cc:econ) is a three-day national innovation summit in Burlington, Vermont to bring together entrepreneurs, investors, and thought leaders pushing toward the next stage of economic development and prosperity in a low-carbon future. We worked with the Vermont Council on Rural Development to build the identity, branding, website, content, and marketing strategy of the summit from the ground up. Our goal? Attract a national audience of change-makers seeking to leave their mark on the planet (figuratively).</p>
        <p>After establishing a base of creative work including video, imagery, and writing, we began plotting strategies for partnerships, press, social media, advertising, and engagement with speakers and attendees.</p>

        <p>Over several months, we advanced through our tactics and built a network of support across the globe. The summit received attention on social media, blogs, and industry publications from the likes of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the World Bankâ€™s Connect4Climate initiative, 1% for the Planet, Green America, the American Sustainable Business Council, and over one hundred other organizations seeking to create a brighter future.</p>
