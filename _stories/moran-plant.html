        <p class="col-sm-9 col-xs-12">Since its heyday as a working coal plant in the mid-20th century, the Moran Plant has existed decrepit. Working closely with New Moran Inc., a non-profit formed to save the building, we conceptualized what a thriving community hub could mean to the city, and developed the foundational pillars to help the project hit the ground running.</p>

                <p>We had visions of harnessing the soulful energy of our community and encouraging it to change forms and flow into the space in a way more human than coal. We started refining the brand messaging to call for community involvement and developed materials to allow for in-person tours of space in order to stimulate personal connections with the building that would catalyze that energy transfer.</p>
