        <div class="story-slider-text">We like interactive design. So, we developed the idea of a customizable weatherization checklist that could offer new ideas for people looking to improve their home's performance. Everybody likes a good list, right? We spread the concept across the website, social media campaigns, and in-person with physical checklists available at hardware stores around the state for customers to take home. Other ways of reaching the public included some of the classics: newspaper ads, radio spots, event posters, and Facebook.</div>

The culmination of the campaign was "Button Up Day," a single day of action where local hardware stores, community centers, and other organizations held events that encouraged the public to weatherize by providing information, demonstrations, rebates, and incentives.</div>
