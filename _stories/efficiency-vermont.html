                <p>We like interactive design. So, we developed the idea of a customizable weatherization checklist that could offer new ideas for people looking to improve their home's performance. We spread the concept across the website, social media campaigns, and in-person with physical checklists available at hardware stores around the state for customers to take home. </p>

The culmination of the campaign was "Button Up Day," a single day of action where local hardware stores, community centers, and other organizations held events that encouraged the public to weatherize by providing information, demonstrations, rebates, and incentives.</div>
