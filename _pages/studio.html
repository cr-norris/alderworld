        <p>Alder is the studio of <a href="http://jasmineparsia.com" target="_blank">Jasmine Parsia</a> & <a href="http://cr-norris.com" target="_blank">Chris Norris</a>. Often joined by other makers and thinkers, we generalize in graphic design, creative direction, production, and digital design.</p>

        <p>Our ability to make things is as important as our ability to make things happen. What we do takes many forms but every project is based on our desire to help shape the ideas that are bettering the world, because we exist for a simple reason: to work toward a future that is healthier and more vibrant than the one we live in now.</p>
